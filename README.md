Hi, I'm Cleves ðŸ‘‹
An ordinary person constantly exploring in the digital world, deeply captivated by every fresh interface and interaction. I love finding inspiration in the details and am dedicated to creating designs that resonate with people.

As an INFP, my mind is always filled with creativity and ideas, but I sometimes face challenges in execution. However, I'm actively working on overcoming this and steadily moving toward bringing my ideas to life ðŸ’ª.

Recently, I've been immersed in using web technologies to build zero-UI-like interactions. Every time I turn abstract ideas into reality, it excites me. This process of transforming imagination into tangible results has made me fall even more in love with my work.
